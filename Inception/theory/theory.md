A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. It is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

● What is async and defer?
async scripts load in the background and run when ready.
async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser only when the file is dowloaded.

Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event).
With defer, browser will run your script when the page finished parsing.
